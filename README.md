## Structure

Airport.cpp & Airport.h are the "nodes" of the doubly linked list. The header file defines all the information in the C++ file.

Airports.cpp & Airports.h contain the methodology of a doubly-linked list.

Main.cpp is the main file that creates a doubly linked list and performs some of the methods assiciated with it.
